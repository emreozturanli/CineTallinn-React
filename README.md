# CineTallinn with React

[See the page](https://cine-tallinn-react.vercel.app/)

- I made a cinema seat selection app with React. 
- In this app I tried to use <b>useContext Hook</b>.
- User can select, deselect seats. 
- If there are selected seats, then user can see the total seats.
- If movie selection changes, selected seats will be deselected.

### I used;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - <b>useState</b>
  - <b>useEffect</b>
  - <b>useContext</b>
  - import/export
  - <b>Props</b>
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>
  - Destructuring props
  - array <b>map</b> method
  - <b>setInterval</b> function
